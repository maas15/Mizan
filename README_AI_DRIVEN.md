## ⚙️ Requirements

### OpenAI API Key (Required)

The application requires an OpenAI API key to function:

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Option 2: Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

**Without an API key, the application cannot generate documents.**
